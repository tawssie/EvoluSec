# EvoluSec: Evolutionary Analysis of Protein Secondary Structures

This repository contains the software associated with the publication:  
**Evolutionary model of protein secondary structure capable of revealing new biological relationships (2020)**

## Overview

This study pioneered the use of 3D protein structural (variations) evolutinoary model to uncover evolutionary relationships, establishing—for the first time—a functional link between Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains and enzymatic activity

The **secondary structure state (DSSP)** evolutionary model was first introduced at the 2017 ISMB conference in the poster:  
**“Inferring protein phylogeny by modelling the evolution of secondary structure”**
The enzymatic activity function was subsequently validated and published in *"NAD+ cleavage activity by animal and plant TIR domains in cell death pathways, Science"*.




## Features

This MATLAB-based software package enables:

- Construction of **phylogenetic trees** based on secondary structure (DSSP)
- Estimation of **evolutionary distances** between proteins based on secondary structure (DSSP)
- Prediction of **ancestral secondary structure states** based on secondary structure (DSSP)

## Purpose

The toolkit is designed to extract evolutionary signals embedded in protein secondary structures—signals that are often overlooked by traditional sequence-based methods. It provides an alternative framework for protein phylogenetic analysis by modelling the evolution of structural features.
