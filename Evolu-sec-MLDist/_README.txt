USAGE:
01. Change MATLAB working directory to "Evolu-sec-Package/Evolu-sec-MLDist"
02. Use "Main" in Matlab terminal to add paths for supporting scripts/functions
03. Use "help EstimateSSDistance" in Matlab terminal to show additional information 
    for secondary structure distance estimation

04. Use following 1 command in MATLAB to run an example for secondary structure distance
    "EstimateSSDistance('example_PF00017_SS.fasta','example_PF00017_SS_result.txt');"
05. Results are calculated and exported in
    "example_PF00017_SS_result.txt"
    
06. Another function for amino acid distance is provided.
    Use following 1 command in MATLAB to run an example for amino acid distance
    "EstimateAADistance('example_PF00017_AA.fasta','example_PF00017_AA_result.txt');"
07. Results are calculated and exported in
    "example_PF00017_AA_result.txt"
